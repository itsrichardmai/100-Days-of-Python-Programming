# Day 15: Coffee Machine Project 

# Print report - tell resources it has left. (water, milk, etc)

# report -> tells all resources we have 
# check resources sufficient when user orders drink? 

<!-- Prompt user by asking what they would like -->

<!-- Turn off coffee machine by entering 'off' to the prompt -->

<!-- Print report: when user enters 'report' a report should be generated that shows the current resource values. -->
